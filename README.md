Isha's Personal Board Designs:

1. ADC/DAC to RPi: This board was initially for a small Payload, but I found an off-the-shelf equivalent compatible with the RPi form factor. Although customizing this board became pretty much obsolete, it will certainly help to refer back to my version if we ever need a chip with more external ADC/DAC interfacing. More than anything, this just became my practice board for getting through the entire board design process.

2. Motor Controller Board: faced a lot of issues with some off-the-shelf motor controller options including frying one of the RPis, so we decided to make our own with necessary protection including 2 flyback diodes and TVS diode shunted to ground.
